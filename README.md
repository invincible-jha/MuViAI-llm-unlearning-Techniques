# LLM Unlearning Project

## Overview

This project aims to implement and evaluate various techniques for unlearning specific data from pre-trained language models (LLMs). The goal is to reduce the influence of unwanted data on the model's performance while maintaining its overall effectiveness.

## Unlearning Process

The unlearning process involves several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess and clean the dataset, ensuring that the data to be unlearned is excluded.
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Implement unlearning algorithms such as fine-tuning, gradient descent unlearning, data augmentation, regularization techniques, and knowledge distillation.
3. **Automation**: Create scripts to automate the unlearning process and test them on a small dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Define and calculate evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness of the unlearning process.
5. **Analysis**: Analyze and visualize the results to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the unlearning algorithms.

## Evaluation Metrics

The following evaluation metrics are used to measure the effectiveness of the unlearning process:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Loss**: The difference between the predicted and actual values, typically measured using cross-entropy loss.

## Unlearning Algorithms

### Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning involves adjusting the model's parameters by training it on a new dataset that excludes the data to be unlearned. This helps the model to reduce the influence of the unwanted data.

### Gradient Descent Unlearning

Gradient descent unlearning targets and removes the influence of specific data points by calculating the gradients of the unwanted data and updating the model's parameters accordingly.

### Data Augmentation

Data augmentation involves creating new training examples that counteract the influence of the data to be unlearned. This helps the model learn new patterns and reduce the impact of the unwanted data.

### Regularization Techniques

Regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization and dropout, are applied during training to reduce the model's reliance on specific data points and improve its generalization capabilities.

### Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation transfers knowledge from the original model to a new model that excludes the unwanted data. This involves training a smaller model (student) to mimic the behavior of the original model (teacher) while excluding the unwanted data.

## Automation Scripts

The following scripts are used to automate the unlearning process:

- `unlearning_algorithm.py`: Implements the unlearning algorithms, including fine-tuning, gradient descent unlearning, data augmentation, regularization techniques, and knowledge distillation.
- `unlearning_script.py`: Automates the unlearning process by running the unlearning algorithms on a small dataset.
- `evaluation_metrics.py`: Defines and calculates the evaluation metrics used to measure the effectiveness of the unlearning process.
- `analyze_results.py`: Analyzes and visualizes the evaluation results, generating plots and charts to compare the model's performance before and after unlearning.
- `user_interface.py`: Provides a user-friendly interface for LLM unlearning, allowing users to input data they want the model to unlearn and receive real-time feedback on the unlearning process.

## Results and Analysis

The results of the unlearning process, including any improvements or changes in the model's performance, are documented and analyzed. Insights are provided on the strengths and weaknesses of the unlearning algorithms, helping to identify areas for further improvement.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive approach to LLM unlearning, implementing and evaluating various techniques to reduce the influence of unwanted data on pre-trained language models. The automation scripts and user interface make it easy to apply the unlearning process and analyze the results, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of different unlearning algorithms.
